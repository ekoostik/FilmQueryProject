## Tech Used
Java 
SQL
Maven
Sublime


## Lessons Learned
On this project I learned a lot about interacting with a database using Java.
A lot of the Java code was review, such as implementation of the interface, method calling, and encapsulation. 
However the syntax involving Drivers, Prepared Statements and SQL was all new.
I really enjoy SQL and honing the Query statement. 
I struggled with the exception aspect of the homework. 
I still need quite a bit of review and study time 
with exceptions.
